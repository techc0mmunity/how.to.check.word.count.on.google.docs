Google Docs can display the word and character count for an entire document or a selected section. This guide outlines how to obtain a word count in a browser and Google Doc apps for Android and iOS.

Word count serves as one way to measure the length of a document. For example, many professional marketing or product papers are between 2,500 and 6,000 words. Blog post lengths vary, yet often end up somewhere between 400 and 1,700 words. Workshop descriptions and speaker biographies for conferences often must be no more than 100 (or so) words.

Here’s how to obtain the live word count for an entire Google Document, or for a selected section of text, in your browser, or in the Google Doc apps for Android and iOS using its build-in word counter. You’ll also learn which content is included in the total word count.
